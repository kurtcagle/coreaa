| **Service**            | A specific set of APIs that allow for interaction with functionality within a module. Services may be internal to the system or may be conducted across a network.           |
| **Network**            | A vehicle for communication across multiple applications or modules.                                                                                                       |

| **Resource**           | A base class for any commoditizable product. Note that this is distinct from the RDF definition of a resource, which is much more generic.                                  |
| **Annotation**         | A particular note or comment that is bound to a generalized entity in the system through a linkage system.                                                                  |
| **DataSet**            | The representation of a particular set of data, typically as an aggregation of a model or time series. Note that datasets are containers of data, but are not representative of operational classes (though they could be). |
| **Schema**             | A schema is a representation of the structure of a dataset, typically in SHACL.                                                                                            |
| **Project**            | A project is an operational entity that represents the development of a given process. This may be subclassed.                                                              |
| **Address**            | A specific locus on the planet, specified by a set of locational indicators.                                                                                               |
| **Contract**           | A contract typically represents a set of transactions that, when complete, signal the completion (successful or otherwise) of a given project.                              |
| **Named Graph**        | A graph is a specific designation within the data mesh that holds relevant content.                                                                                        |
| **Presentation**       | A presentation is a transformation on either a dataset or a graph of data into a form consumable by either humans or other computer systems.                                 |
| **Template**           | A template is a subcomponent of a presentation used to specify both common structural elements and operational code.                                                        |
| **Social Event**       | A social event is a meeting, conference, class, or related gathering. It is differentiated from the abstract Event class.                                                  |
| **Geopolitical Region**| This is used to indicate a particular contained geo-region, such as a country, state or province, or city. This is an abstract class that is further partitioned into smaller regions. |

### Conceptual and Foundational Classes

|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Units**                | These identify specific unit definitions and are built to be analogous to the QUDT specification.                                                                          |

| **Biometric Classifications** | This is an abstract class that encapsulates partitioned biometric qualities.                                                                                               |
| **Feature**              | A feature is a way of describing a particular strength or intensity value (as a normalized real number between 0 and 1) of a given abstract concept, such as heat, emotional states, competency, interest, or other poll-like values. |
| **Currency**             | This typically indicates a given unit of currency secured by a given governmental or quasi-governmental entity.                                                              |
| **Others**               | This list can get very large quickly, but it should be understood as a sample, rather than something comprehensive.                                                         |

These tables summarize the operational and conceptual/foundational classes, providing a clear description of each.
